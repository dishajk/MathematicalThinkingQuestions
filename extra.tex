\item Let $a$ be a positive integer. The Collatz sequence $C(a)$ is defined recursively as follows:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{lcl}
    a_1 &=& a \\
    a_{n+1}&=&\flatfrac{a_n}{2} \text { if } a_n \text{ is even, and}\\
    a_{n+1}&=&3a_n+1 \text{ if } n \text{ is odd.}
  \end{array}
\end{equation*}
Find all the terms of the Collatz sequences $C(1)$ and $C(12)$. Can you find a formula for the $n$th term?

\item Look up the sequences $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55,\ldots$ Can you find a formula for the $n$th term of this sequence?
\item Find a formula for the $n$th positive odd number.
\item Can you find a formula for the $n$th number with odd digits?
